## Background

Every team struggles with the same problems:
- **Context evaporates** between sessions, forcing constant re-discovery
- **Parallel work creates conflicts** when multiple developers touch the same code
- **Requirements drift** as verbal decisions override written specs
- **Progress becomes invisible** until the very end

This system solves all of that.

## The Workflow

    D --> E[Parallel Execution]
```

### Complete Workflow (32 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Validate your idea (18 min, fully automated)
/pm:validate-idea IDEA.md
# ‚Üí Generates: VALIDATED-IDEA.md with GO/NO-GO decision

# 2. Setup project structure (2 min)
/pm:new-project my-project

# 3. Create comprehensive PRD from validated research (8 min)
/pm:prd-new project-foundation --from-idea VALIDATED-IDEA.md

# 4. Transform PRD into technical implementation plan (4 min)
/pm:prd-parse project-foundation
/pm:epic-oneshot project-foundation

# 5. Start parallel development
/pm:issue-start 1234
```

## What Makes This Different?

| Traditional Development | Claude Code PM System |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Manual idea validation** | **‚ú® Automated validation** with 15+ web searches & lean startup framework |
| Context lost between sessions | **Persistent context** across all work |
| Serial task execution | **Parallel agents** on independent tasks |
| "Vibe coding" from memory | **Spec-driven** with full traceability |
| Progress hidden in branches | **Transparent audit trail** in GitHub |
| Manual task coordination | **Intelligent prioritization** with `/pm:next` |

## Why GitHub Issues?

Most Claude Code workflows operate in isolation ‚Äì a single developer working with AI in their local environment. This creates a fundamental problem: **AI-assisted development becomes a silo**.

By using GitHub Issues as our database, we unlock something powerful:

### ü§ù **True Team Collaboration**
- Multiple Claude instances can work on the same project simultaneously
- Human developers see AI progress in real-time through issue comments
- Team members can jump in anywhere ‚Äì the context is always visible
- Managers get transparency without interrupting flow

### üîÑ **Seamless Human-AI Handoffs**
- AI can start a task, human can finish it (or vice versa)
- Progress updates are visible to everyone, not trapped in chat logs
- Code reviews happen naturally through PR comments
- No "what did the AI do?" meetings

### üìà **Scalable Beyond Solo Work**
- Add team members without onboarding friction
- Multiple AI agents working in parallel on different issues
- Distributed teams stay synchronized automatically
- Works with existing GitHub workflows and tools

### üéØ **Single Source of Truth**
- No separate databases or project management tools
- Issue state is the project state
- Comments are the audit trail
- Labels provide organization

This isn't just a project management system ‚Äì it's a **collaboration protocol** that lets humans and AI agents work together at scale, using infrastructure your team already trusts.

## Core Principle: No Vibe Coding

> **Every line of code must trace back to a specification.**

We follow a strict 5-phase discipline:

1. **üß† Brainstorm** - Think deeper than comfortable
2. **üìù Document** - Write specs that leave nothing to interpretation
3. **üìê Plan** - Architect with explicit technical decisions
4. **‚ö° Execute** - Build exactly what was specified
5. **üìä Track** - Maintain transparent progress at every step

No shortcuts. No assumptions. No regrets.

```

## Workflow Phases

### 1. Product Planning Phase

```bash
/pm:prd-new feature-name
```
Launches comprehensive brainstorming to create a Product Requirements Document capturing vision, user stories, success criteria, and constraints.

**Output:** `.claude/prds/feature-name.md`

### 2. Implementation Planning Phase

```bash
/pm:prd-parse feature-name
```
Transforms PRD into a technical implementation plan with architectural decisions, technical approach, and dependency mapping.

**Output:** `.claude/epics/feature-name/epic.md`

### 3. Task Decomposition Phase

```bash
/pm:epic-decompose feature-name
```
Breaks epic into concrete, actionable tasks with acceptance criteria, effort estimates, and parallelization flags.

**Output:** `.claude/epics/feature-name/[task].md`

### 4. GitHub Synchronization

```bash
/pm:epic-sync feature-name
# Or for confident workflows:
/pm:epic-oneshot feature-name
```
Pushes epic and tasks to GitHub as issues with appropriate labels and relationships.

### 5. Execution Phase

```bash
/pm:issue-start 1234  # Launch specialized agent
/pm:issue-sync 1234   # Push progress updates
/pm:next             # Get next priority task
```
Specialized agents implement tasks while maintaining progress updates and an audit trail.

## The Parallel Execution System

### Issues Aren't Atomic

Traditional thinking: One issue = One developer = One task

**Reality: One issue = Multiple parallel work streams**

A single "Implement user authentication" issue isn't one task. It's...

- **Agent 1**: Database tables and migrations
- **Agent 2**: Service layer and business logic
- **Agent 3**: API endpoints and middleware
- **Agent 4**: UI components and forms
- **Agent 5**: Test suites and documentation

All running **simultaneously** in the same worktree.

### The Math of Velocity

**Traditional Approach:**
- Epic with 3 issues
- Sequential execution

**This System:**
- Same epic with 3 issues
- Each issue splits into ~4 parallel streams
- **12 agents working simultaneously**

We're not assigning agents to issues. We're **leveraging multiple agents** to ship faster.

### Context Optimization

**Traditional single-thread approach:**
- Main conversation carries ALL the implementation details
- Context window fills with database schemas, API code, UI components
- Eventually hits context limits and loses coherence

**Parallel agent approach:**
- Main thread stays clean and strategic
- Each agent handles its own context in isolation
- Implementation details never pollute the main conversation
- Main thread maintains oversight without drowning in code

Your main conversation becomes the conductor, not the orchestra.

### GitHub vs Local: Perfect Separation

**What GitHub Sees:**
- Clean, simple issues
- Progress updates
- Completion status

**What Actually Happens Locally:**
- Issue #1234 explodes into 5 parallel agents
- Agents coordinate through Git commits
- Complex orchestration hidden from view

GitHub doesn't need to know HOW the work got done ‚Äì just that it IS done.

### The Command Flow

```bash
# Analyze what can be parallelized
/pm:issue-analyze 1234

# Launch the swarm
/pm:epic-start memory-system

# Watch the magic
# 12 agents working across 3 issues
# All in: ../epic-memory-system/

# One clean merge when done
/pm:epic-merge memory-system
```

## Key Features & Benefits

### üß† **Context Preservation**
Never lose project state again. Each epic maintains its own context, agents read from `.claude/context/`, and updates locally before syncing.

### ‚ö° **Parallel Execution**
Ship faster with multiple agents working simultaneously. Tasks marked `parallel: true` enable conflict-free concurrent development.

### üîó **GitHub Native**
Works with tools your team already uses. Issues are the source of truth, comments provide history, and there is no dependency on the Projects API.

### ü§ñ **Agent Specialization**
Right tool for every job. Different agents for UI, API, and database work. Each reads requirements and posts updates automatically.

### üí° **Idea-to-PRD Enhancement**
Transform raw ideas into structured PRDs through guided brainstorming. `/pm:prd-new --from-idea` uses your initial concept as a foundation for comprehensive product planning, asking targeted questions to build complete requirements.

### üìä **Full Traceability**
Every decision is documented. Idea ‚Üí PRD ‚Üí Epic ‚Üí Task ‚Üí Issue ‚Üí Code ‚Üí Commit. Complete audit trail from concept to production.

### üöÄ **Developer Productivity**
Focus on building, not managing. Intelligent prioritization, automatic context loading, and incremental sync when ready.

## Proven Results

## Local vs Remote

| Operation | Local | GitHub |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| PRD Creation | ‚úÖ | ‚Äî |
| Implementation Planning | ‚úÖ | ‚Äî |
| Task Breakdown | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ (sync) |
| Execution | ‚úÖ | ‚Äî |
| Status Updates | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ (sync) |
| Final Deliverables | ‚Äî | ‚úÖ |

## Technical Notes

### GitHub Integration
- Uses **gh-sub-issue extension** for proper parent-child relationships
- Falls back to task lists if extension not installed
- Epic issues track sub-task completion automatically
- Labels provide additional organization (`epic:feature`, `task:feature`)

### File Naming Convention
- Tasks start as `001.md`, `002.md` during decomposition
- After GitHub sync, renamed to `{issue-id}.md` (e.g., `1234.md`)
- Makes it easy to navigate: issue #1234 = file `1234.md`

### Design Decisions
- Intentionally avoids GitHub Projects API complexity
- All commands operate on local files first for speed
- Synchronization with GitHub is explicit and controlled
- Worktrees provide clean git isolation for parallel work
- GitHub Projects can be added separately for visualization
