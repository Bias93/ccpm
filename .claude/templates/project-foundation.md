# Project Foundation PRD Template

Use this template when creating a PRD for a brand new project with `/pm:prd-new project-foundation`.

## Project Vision

**What is this project?**
[Brief description of the project idea]

**Why does this project exist?**
[Problem being solved or opportunity being addressed]

**What success looks like?**
[Clear success metrics and outcomes]

## Core Features

**MVP Feature Set:**
1. [Essential feature 1]
2. [Essential feature 2] 
3. [Essential feature 3]

**Future Features (Post-MVP):**
- [Feature for later]
- [Feature for later]

## Technical Foundation

**Architecture Decisions:**
- Frontend: [React/Vue/Angular/Vanilla]
- Backend: [Node.js/Python/Go/etc]
- Database: [PostgreSQL/MongoDB/SQLite]
- Deployment: [Vercel/AWS/Docker]
- Authentication: [Auth0/Firebase/Custom]

**Project Structure:**
```
