# Project-Specific Subagent Template

This template generates specialized subagents for individual projects based on PRD requirements and technology stack decisions.

## Template Variables

- `{project}` - Project name (kebab-case)
- `{role}` - Agent role (setup, backend, frontend, data, testing, deployment, integration)
- `{stack}` - Technology stack (e.g., "Next.js 15 + Prisma + PostgreSQL")
- `{requirements}` - Key requirements from PRD
- `{model}` - Claude model (haiku/sonnet/opus)
- `{tools}` - Required tools (typically "Read, Write, Edit, Bash")

## Model Assignment Guidelines

### Haiku (Fast & Cost-Effective)
- **setup-specialist**: Project initialization, config files
- Simple, repetitive tasks with clear patterns

### Sonnet (Balanced Performance)  
- **backend-specialist**: API development, business logic
- **frontend-specialist**: UI components, state management
- **data-specialist**: Schema design, migrations  
- **integration-specialist**: External API integration
- Most development tasks requiring domain expertise

### Opus (Maximum Capability)
- **testing-specialist**: Complex test strategy and architecture
- **deployment-specialist**: CI/CD pipeline design and monitoring
- Critical infrastructure and quality assurance tasks

## Usage Instructions

1. **Agent Generation**: Use `/pm:agent-generate <project>` command
2. **Customization**: Modify generated agents for specific project needs
3. **Task Assignment**: Reference agents in epic-decompose tasks
4. **Iteration**: Update agents as project requirements evolve

## Best Practices

✅ Keep agents focused on their specific domain  
✅ Include full project context in each agent  
✅ Use appropriate model for task complexity  
✅ Maintain consistency across all project agents  
✅ Update agents when project stack changes  
✅ Document any custom modifications
